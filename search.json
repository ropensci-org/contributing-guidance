    "text": "Our work is driven by our vision and mission.\nrOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software.\nWe do this by:\n\nCreating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web, and the R-universe to enhance the publication and discovery of research software in R.\nCreating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community, enhanced by mentoring and localization efforts for broader inclusivity and accessibility.\n\nMaking the right data, tools and best practices more discoverable\n\nBuilding capacity of software users and developers and fostering a sense of pride in their work\nPromoting advocacy for a culture of data sharing and reusable software\n\nOur goal is to build confidence and a sense of belonging for people of all backgrounds, particularly those who might not see themselves as software developers (as many scientists may not!). We do this through building trust and establishing shared norms for working openly, leveraging and creating open source software and resources that support open, reproducible science.\n\nEveryone in the community, no matter how accomplished they are in their own specialty, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. We learn from others by using their code and documentation, their blogs and tutorials, their talks and webinars. We learn with others online through Twitter, discussion forums and Slack channels, and in person through coding clubs, hacky hours, meetups, workshops and conferences. And we learn for others by writing tutorials and blogs about our own learning processes, or adding or fulfilling feature requests, which we can then contribute back to the community.

    "section": "\n1.2 Our Community",
    "text": "1.2 Our Community\nOur community is our best asset! Without the secret sauce that is the Humans of rOpenSci, we’re just a lot of (really good) packages and processes. Our community is an ephemeral thing. It’s everywhere and nowhere. It’s people who believe in our mission and share our values, and have a mindset for learning, improving, and innovating together. It’s people who prioritize open, reusable, and reproducible research software while also prioritizing creating inclusive spaces through empathy and building trust. There are no stupid questions at rOpenSci; everyone appreciates the diversity of expertise and entryways to coding in this thing we love called R.\nThe rOpenSci community is a self-identifying group composed of users and developers of R software tools who, together, contribute to the technical and social infrastructure for open and reproducible research. Our specific focus is on software and best practices that lower the barriers to working with scientific data sources. Community members are people who use, cite and share use cases for rOpenSci packages, attend or present in our Community Calls, write a post for our blog, participated in an rOpenSci unconf, or in our research domain focused communities like rOpenSci-Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research, answer questions in our fora, actively participate in the life of an rOpenSci project reporting problems and recommending or implementing solutions, contribute to, or maintain a package, are Champions, mentors or trainers in our Champions Program, localize our material, or participate in rOpenSci peer review as a reviewer, author or editor.\nHaving a diverse community is important to us. We welcome anyone dedicated to making their science more open and supporting others in that pursuit, no matter their technical expertise, career stage, or work sector. Further, we welcome people of all backgrounds, including but not limited to any sexuality, gender identity, and race. We are anti-racist. We recognize that communities are not inclusive by default, particularly as they grow: they require deliberate attention. We are carrying out a Champions Program and Localization projects to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities. We are all supported by rOpenSci’s Community Manager and a Code of Conduct that has clear guidelines for behavior and reporting, and is enforced by a committee including rOpenSci staff and an independent community member.\n\n1.2.1 Humans of rOpenSci\nIn this section we point to groups of people with various formal and informal roles in our community. This gives some transparency, may help people “recognize themselves” in some roles, and provide a foundation to allow folks to reach out to others to learn about making contributions.\nrOpenSci was founded in 2011 by Karthik Ram, Scott Chamberlain, and Carl Boettiger, ecologists who were motivated to make scientific data retrieval reproducible.\nStaff are:\nNoam Ross (Executive Director), Jeroen Ooms (Lead Infrastructure Engineer), Yanina Bellini Saibene (Community Manager), Mark Padgham (Software Review Lead), Maëlle Salmon (Research Software Engineer) and Steffi LaZerte (Community Assistant) .\nScott Chamberlain (Technical Lead), Stefanie Butland (Community Manager) and Stacey Dorton (Administrative Manager) are Staff alumni.\nStrategic Advisors\nKarthik Ram (Advisor), Carl Boettiger (University of California, Berkeley), Jenny Bryan (Posit) and Rich FitzJohn (Imperial College London) volunteer their time.\nSoftware peer review Editors\nNoam Ross (Executive Director), Mark Padgham (Software Review Lead), Maëlle Salmon (Research Software Engineer), Anna Krystalli (Research Software Engineering consultant / Data Scientist), Mauro Lepore (Theia Finance Labs), Laura DeCicco (USGS), Emily Riederer (Capital One), Adam Sparks (Curtin University), Jeff Hollister (US Environmental Protection Agency), Rebecca Killick (Lancaster University), Toby Hocking (Northern Arizona University), Emi Tanaka (Biological Data Science Institute, Australian National University), Jouni Helske (University of Jyväskylä, Finland), Beatriz Milz (Federal University of ABC (UFABC), Brazil), Margaret Siple (NOAA AFSC Groundfish Assessment Program - RACE division), Nima Hejazi (Harvard Chan School of Public Health) and Andrew Heiss (Georgia State University) volunteer their time.\nScott Chamberlain (Technical Lead), Lincoln Mullen (George Mason University), Brooke Anderson (Colorado State University), Melina Vidoni (RMIT University), Julia Gustavsen (Agroscope), Ben Bolker (McMaster University), Stephanie Hicks (Johns Hopkins University), Paula Moraga (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) and Leonardo Collado-Torres (Lieber Institute for Brain Development) are Editor alumni.\nRead posts introducing Laura DeCicco, Julia Gustavsen, Mauro Lepore, Brooke Anderson and Melina Vidoni, and Anna Krystalli and Lincoln Mullen. We occasionally recruit guest editors for some package reviews.\n\n\nhttps://ropensci.org/about/ screenshot completed\n\n\n\n\nHeadshots of the rOpensci team\n\n\nGet to know some of the more experienced folks in our community by reading the .Rprofile series of posts for which Kelly O’Briant interviewed Mara Averick, Jenny Bryan, Julia Stewart Lowndes (with assistance from Sean Kross), Karthik Ram, Noam Ross, Julia Silge, and David Smith.\nYou can also have a look at some of the teams and people behind the development of software and packages many of us use and which are available through the R-Universe by reading the The Stars of the R-Universe series of post.\nOver 150 people have reviewed 135 packages from 803 authors!\nMore than 90 people have presented in our Community Calls attended by more than 900 people in more than 50 countries.\nYou can get to know some community members by reading the blog posts and tech notes they’ve written about their packages, their reviewer experiences, the Community Calls they’ve presented in, or their career paths in R. We have an authors page on our website that allows you to find these people by name. The authors page does not yet include rOpenSci package authors.\n\n\nScreenshot of the rOpenSci authors page showing thumbnails of author avatars next to their names\n\n\nMany of rOpenSci’s tools are developed by practicing scientists and other researchers who foster strong communities among users and developers in their research domains and openly share their expertise in discussions of best practices.\n\nThe Antarctic/Southern Ocean rOpenSci community led by Ben Raymond, Jess Melbourne-Thomas, Sara Labrousse, Michael Sumner, and Anton Van de Putte aims to strengthen the community of R users and developers in this area of research.\nHydrology researchers Louise Slater, Sam Zipper, Sam Albers, Ilaria Prosdocimi, Claudia Vitolo, and others promote open package development and peer review in their paper Using R in Hydrology and some of them created and maintain the rOpenSci Task View on hydrological data and modeling in which many of the R packages have been peer reviewed through rOpenSci.\nCommunity members who are academic experts in climate and weather (Brooke Anderson), archaeology (Ben Marwick), transport (Robin Lovelace), hydrology (see above), and Antarctic research (see above) highlighted sources of open data for research in their fields and the R tools to access them in When Field or Lab Work is not an Option - Leveraging Open Data Resources for Remote Research\n\n\nMany in the rOpenSci community participate in related organizations and communities like R-Ladies, The Carpentries, Latin American R community, the MiR community for underrepresented minority users of R, AfricaR, and Bioconductor.\nWe believe in giving credit to people for their contributions and sharing our gratitude. Our Thank You, 2019 post, acknowledging individual contributors, is one example of how we do that. For package authors participating in software peer review, we encourage “gratitude through semantic metadata” with the option to acknowledge reviewers in the package DESCRIPTION (with reviewers’ consent).\n\n\n1.2.2 The special case of rOpenSci unconfs\nBetween 2014 and 2019 we held in-person hackathon-flavored unconferences - five in the US and four in Australia. The “rOpenSci unconf” became a place where people met, created and developed projects together, and got to know each other. You can get a feel for our unconfs by reading blog posts about the events and projects and by listening to the Credibly Curious podcast episode recorded during ozunconf18 by Nick Tierney and Saskia Freytag. Through these we fostered a community of trust that functions online effectively and with kindness. Our unconfs empowered many participants to run their own local unconferences, make new projects happen, build new communities, build relationships that led to collaborations and career moves. Perhaps the biggest impact of rOpenSci unconfs was on peoples’ confidence and their perceptions of the value they each bring to the world of R in open research.\nRest assured, we’re pondering how to continue building this trust network through collaborative online events.\n\nThe rOpenSci model has contributed much hidden skills and relationship infrastructure that has helped #rstats flourish. It’s been a delight to participate in this and see people that got a start at an unconf gain confidence and grow into heavyweight community contributors and leaders over the years. Miles McBain on Twitter\n\n\nMy life took a turn thanks to rOpenSci - the community I was welcomed into there gave me deep friendships, new skills & confidence to get out of my comfort zone. And the #rstats world as a whole is better for rOpenSci’s existence.

    "text": "Contributors to rOpenSci come with a wide range of motivations, which can include wanting a tangible way to participate in open science. First-time contributions may come from people in different places on a continuum of experience: from those who consider themselves newcomers exploring the landscape and trying to see where they fit, all the way to more experienced folks who know exactly what they have to offer and what they would like to contribute.\nContributing to rOpenSci can help you build your track record of public contributions (such as code or documentation on GitHub), and may help improve your CV for job, fellowship, or award applications.\nParticipation in an open source project like rOpenSci is more likely to be a lifecycle than a linear path. Having a package pass peer review for the first time can feel like a huge milestone. You might write a blog post about the package, “give back” by participating as a reviewer or mentoring someone else in their first review, or answering questions about package maintenance. But as a person becomes more experienced, they may move on. The value someone might get out of participating here will change over time and that is perfectly ok.\nDo you already know what value you want to get out of contributing? (It’s ok if you don’t know yet.) To help you recognize yourself, we’ve categorized what we think contributors to rOpenSci want into: Discover; Connect; Learn; Build; Help.

We carry out our work using multiple channels for one-way and multi-way communications that involve different levels of commitment.\nGitHub is the platform we use to host our software and documentation projects using Git version control. Our newsletter, delivered every two weeks, is the ideal way to stay informed without being overwhelmed by communication channels. We use our public discussion forum, Mastodon, and Slack, each for specific modes of making announcements, promoting contributions from community members, asking and answering questions about rOpenSci packages and recommended best practices, knowledge-sharing and exploration of ideas, as well as more passive learning by “listening” to community wisdom.\nThe following table lists every communication channel and its purpose. Below that we describe how we use a few specific channels and provide some advice on deciding whether a question you might have is one for rOpenSci or belongs in a more general forum.\n\n\n\nChannel\nPurpose\n\n\n\nWebsite https://ropensci.org/ https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3\n\nHome of rOpenSci\n\n\nNewsletter\nA digest of R package news, use cases, blog posts, events, curated every two weeks.

In this Guide we use terms like “opening an issue” to refer to tracking ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs in a project, and “making a pull request” to submit your proposed fix or new feature. If you’d like some general information on the language and workflow of GitHub, see Collaborating with issues and pull requests. To learn about Markdown formatting for interacting with others in issues and pull requests see Getting started with writing and formatting on GitHub. For guidance on connecting R to GitHub we recommend Happy Git and GitHub for the useR - https://happygitwithr.com/.\n\n\n\nSlack\nWe use Slack as a semi-open space for communications among people who have made specific contributions to rOpenSci. These include people who:\n\nhave begun the software review process for their package (once it’s determined to be in scope)\nare assigned to review a package\n\nmade significant contributions to rOpenSci, including taking over maintenance of an rOpenSci package\nhave written a blog post or tech note that is published on our site\npresented in a Community Call\n\nparticipated in an unconf\n\nuse R in a research domain that rOpenSci is explicitly supporting, such as Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research\n\nPeople join Slack by invitation from our Community Manager or other staff. If you are eligible, you may contact us via our contact form; provide your full name and email address.\n\nThe benefit of Slack is the ability to more directly access rOpenSci staff and community members, including some more experienced folks in channels like #software-review or #package-maintenance, or to watch for postings in #jobs. People consider it an easier place to ask questions or explore ideas because while it has over 500 members, it’s not fully “in the open”. We actively welcome new members and ensure that all conversations are collegial.\n\n\n\nHow to get help\nThere is an etiquette to getting help and asking questions. We focus on using, developing, documenting code and infrastructure, and building community, as they specifically align with our mission.\nPeople looking for more general R learning may refer to RStudio Education and The Carpentries.\nRead these posts if you have an R question: Where to get help with your R question?, by Maëlle Salmon; Getting help in R: do as I say, not as I’ve done, by Samantha Tyner.\nIf you’re asking for R help, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature, you’re more likely to succeed if you include a good reproducible example, a “reprex”. There’s a well-documented package for that including a video, and an rOpenSci Community Call - How to Ask Questions so they get Answered! Possibly by Yourself!, with Jenny Bryan, JD Long, and Scott Chamberlain.\n\n3.2.1 How to contribute?\n\nRead our Code of Conduct to ensure you are ready to participate\nFollow rOpenSci on Mastodon\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nAsk or answer questions.

They give you a feeling for how we blend rigorous expertise and recommendations with a friendly and safe way for all participants - presenters and attendees - to stretch themselves. They’re free and open for anyone to attend, and provide an opportunity to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world. Our session on Maintaining an R package had 90 participants from 18 countries!\nWe’ve run more than 25 Community Calls since their start in 2015. Topics range widely and include Reproducible research with R, Testing, Security for R, How do you review code that accompanies a research project or paper?, Involving multilingual communities, Research applications of rOpenSci taxonomy and biodiversity tools, Governance strategies for open source research software projects and more!\n\nThere’s nothing like hearing a lively technical banter of experts to pick up the vernacular that one can easily build upon. The first-hand tips and tricks, do’s and don’ts, personal anecdotes of what worked beautifully and what crashed terribly, offered by years of experience are yet unmatched in bringing newbies into speaking the community’s language. Janani Ravi in “Maintaining an R Package - Community Call Summary”\n\nThese are not your usual webinar. Some calls might involve two to three speakers on a topic, some give an introduction to our tools in a specific research domain followed by several people presenting their use cases for those tools, and some are a moderated discussion among experts. We always leave at least 20 minutes for Q&A. We use collaborative note-taking allowing participants to share their own ideas or resources and to ask and answer questions.\n\nThis live shared document helps everyone … formulate what they would like to say. It also gives people the option to participate without having to … speak up on the call (thus reducing the barrier for people, especially newcomers, to ask questions). The document also gives an opportunity for anyone in the community to share their expertise … Janani Ravi in “Maintaining an R Package - Community Call Summary”\n\nRecordings of all past calls are available online, with closed captions (transcript of dialogue visible in text on video) for all calls in 2020 or later.\n\n\n\nExamples of community call thumbnails from our Vimeo page\n\n\n\n3.3.1 How to contribute?\n\n\nAttend a Community Call.

    "text": "3.7 Packages & Docs\nThe Packages page on our website lists our carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R tools that lower barriers to working with open data sources for various research applications. Of over 400 packages, about 30.0% have been peer reviewed, and more than half are on CRAN.\nThe list is maintained in our registry, which contains much more metadata about the packages. Documentation for rOpenSci packages is built and hosted at an automated documentation server (docs.ropensci.org; docs repository).\nYou can discover packages by searching with a package name, name of the maintainer (maybe you’re a fan of their work), or by keywords in the description such as “taxonomy” or “weather”. Clicking on any package row expands the listing to include a package description and list of academic citations. Clicking on the “View Documentation” Button takes you to the docs page where you can find information on using the package from Getting Started, Articles and Vignettes, and on making contributions from reporting bugs, to submitting feature requests or bug fixes. If present, clicking on the “Peer-reviewed” badge will bring you to the peer-review discussion thread.\n\nScreen shot of packages list showing expanded information on the bomrang package and what to click to access different information\n\n\nOften the best way to start learning about a package is to install it, and start playing with it. Try some of the examples, maybe on your own data, or with your own use case. You can learn more about how to use a package by reading blog posts and tech notes tagged with package names (like tesseract or taxize). Browse the tags page to find posts. Find examples of how others use them by browsing the UsesCases category of our public forum. Some of our Community Calls focus on packages in a specific domain. Check out our archive with videos of past calls. Looking for more examples? Ask in the forum.\nMost developers are interested to hear from you while you’re getting to know a package Is there something unclear in the documentation? Some parts of the software you find confusing? It’s helpful if you share these experiences When possible, use a reprex“, a reproducible example.\nWhile package maintainers have the ultimate say on package features, they are often eager to modify a package to accommodate real world use cases If you have a particular feature request in mind, open an issue in the package repository with a succinct idea, and ideally a minimal reproducible example if code is applicable Avoid emailing maintainers directly - it may be tempting but benefits no one else For some, it’s a challenge to have the confidence to make your suggestion in the open, but taking that step can help others This also helps maintainers manage their work by keeping communications within the GitHub infrastructure that houses the package.\nYou can also help out by addressing issues (see the Issues List), or making pull requests to add features, fix bugs, add documentation, or add vignettes or articles To do so, take a look at the project’s contributing guide (here’s a nice example from Peter Desmet, and another from Noam Ross), then open an issue to discuss your approach with the author Create a pull request and submit your proposed solution!\n\n3.7.1 How to contribute?\n\n\nBrowse rOpenSci packages\nBrowse package Task Views\n\nUse an rOpenSci package (Yes, that is a contribution!)\nTell a friend about an rOpenSci package that may be useful for their work\n\nBrowse citations of rOpenSci packages to find interesting applications\n\nCite rOpenSci packages in manuscripts and presentations and encourage your colleagues to cite software Manuscript citations will appear on our packages page.\n\n\nJust learned that the webchem package was cited in a paper by a group of oncologists It totally made my morning to think that my code might someday contribute a teensy tiny bit to better treatments for cancer. Eric Scott on Twitter\n\n\n\nWrite a post about using rOpenSci packages on your own blog\n\nReport a bug by opening an issue. If you’re asking for R help, reporting a bug, or requesting a new feature, you’re more likely to succeed if you include a good reprex (a reproducible example).\n\nReview the documentation and give feedback to the author in an issue on any parts that are confusing\n\nMake a pull request to fix a typo or a bug, to add/fix examples, to add/clarify documentation, to add/update a citation file\n\nMake a feature request by opening an issue in a package that’s critical for your work\n\nWrite a vignette/article for a package.

    "text": "3.10 Issues list\nHere we describe how to find and consider working on open issues in rOpenSci projects. In 2019, 117 people made their first-ever code contribution to rOpenSci! The rOpenSci issues list is a dynamic search on GitHub showing all open issues in the “rOpenSci GitHub organization”, and the rOpenSci Help Wanted page shows a subset of open issues labelled help wanted.\nIssues in GitHub are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs. For general information on using issues see the documentation on Managing your work with issues, and the GitHub Guide Mastering Issues. Issues can be opened by anyone - the package maintainer, a user reporting a bug or something in the documentation that’s confusing, or a person proposing their idea for contributing. For more sources of information on using GitHub see Communication channels.\nMany of our packages are developed by busy community members working in research environments in which software development is a voluntary, side project. These developers often appreciate help in addressing open issues in their packages. These can involve either code or non-code contributions. Some will be suitable for beginners and some will require more experience. To contribute, see if there is an issue that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the maintainer. Once your proposed plan is accepted by the maintainer, create a pull request and submit your solution. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get an immediate response. It will depend on the popularity of a package and whether maintaining it is part of a person’s “day job”.\nThe easiest way to look at issues is to browse all help wanted issues on the rOpenSci website.\nAlternatively, you can look at all open issues in rOpenSci with org:ropensci state:open https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci++state%3Aopen&type=Issues\nTry narrowing down your search for open issues by searching for specific labels.\n\n\nhelp wanted (GitHub search terms org:ropensci label:\"help wanted\" state:open)\n\ngood first issue (GitHub search terms org:ropensci label:\"good first issue\" state:open)\n\ndocumentation (GitHub search terms org:ropensci label:\"documentation\" state:open)\n\nfeature (GitHub search terms org:ropensci label:\"feature\" state:open)\n\nYou can also combine labels in a search. For example, org:ropensci label:\"help wanted\" label:\"good first issue\" state:open\n\nRemember! Not all issues require coding!\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a Non-coding ‘help wanted’ issue called ‘Example use cases, tutorials, and applications’ from the tabulizer package repository on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nNon-Coding “help wanted” issue\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a Coding ‘help wanted’ issue called ‘Improve code coverage’ from the jsor package repository on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nCoding “help wanted” issue\nAre you a package author who wants to encourage people to help with issues in your project? Consider making your packages “contribution and collaboration friendly” by including a code of conduct and a contribution guide.\nSome good examples of contribution guides are this one from Peter Desmet, and this one from Noam Ross.\nYou can also label issues as suggested above. We keep track of newly labelled help wanted issues and post about them to help developers get help.\n\n3.10.1 How to contribute?\n\nFor package authors: Label your issues so people interested in contributing can find them. We recommend “help wanted” (no hyphen), “good first issue”, “beginner”\nFor package authors: Include future plans for your package in the README and open issues to address aspects of your plan.\n\nAddress a “Help wanted” issue. Take a look at the Help Wanted page. If you see one that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the author. Create a pull request and submit your solution!\n\nAddress any open issue. The majority of issues are not labelled “help wanted” but that doesn’t mean the author wouldn’t appreciate your help. Browse the issues in a package you use and see if there’s one you could address. This is a great way to get your favorite packages work the way you want them to!"

    "text": "3.11 Dev Guide: Development, maintenance, and peer review of rOpenSci packages\n\n\n\n\n\nDev guide book cover in light blue showing assembly line chain of people handling packages in white\n\n\n\n\n\nOur online guide “rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review” a.k.a. the “Dev Guide”, is a resource for authors, maintainers, reviewers and editors of rOpenSci packages.\nrOpenSci has been running a software peer review system since 2015 to combine the best of academic peer review with software review. Having robust and reliable software tools is an important component of supporting open science and reproducible research. The Dev Guide was developed as a resource to help support and streamline these efforts and to promote best practices. It contains a huge amount of information including:\n\nStandards and best practices for building packages, such as creating and testing packages, continuous integration and security.\n\nThe peer review process, including policies and guides for authors and reviewers\n\nAre you wondering what it’s like to review a package for the first time, or how long it might take? Explore the Dev Guide sections on Why submit your package to rOpenSci? and Guide for Reviewers. Read blog posts with the “reviewer” tag. Many people review an R package before ever making one. Check out the list of past reviewers. Maybe you know one of them and can ask about their experience.\n\nAs a useR, you are qualified as a potential package reviewer if you have some appreciation for what makes your favourite packages useful. Miles McBain in “Where is the value in package peer review?”\n\nIf you’re interested in submitting a package for peer-review, read the Dev Guide section Why review packages for rOpenSci? or read blog posts with the “software-peer-review” tag to get the perspectives of authors whose packages have passed peer review as well as learn about the process itself.\nOnce you’ve submitted your package and an editor has assigned reviewers, you and the reviewers will be invited to join rOpenSci’s Slack workspace where you can connect more directly with members of the rOpenSci community, including other reviewers, package authors, users, and the rOpenSci staff and leadership team.\nWhen you submit your package for review, consider also publishing a journal article about your package. We have collaborative agreements with two journals. If you choose to submit an article to the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), it will be evaluated by JOSS based on the completed rOpenSci review. To submit to Methods in Ecology and Evolution, you can submit to a joint review process whereby your package is reviewed by rOpenSci, followed by a fast-tracked review of the manuscript by Methods in Ecology and Evolution.\nFinally, make sure your package is easily citable to get credit for all your hard work! Use the use_citation() function from the usethis package to add a CITATION file so users can use citation(\"yourpackage\") to easily find how to best cite your package. It’s also useful to add a section to your README letting users know how you’d like them to cite your package.\nSometimes an rOpenSci package maintainer finds that maintaining a package is no longer feasible for them. When that happens, we work hard to find new maintainers. If you think you might be interested, the Dev Guide Chapter on Changing Maintainers is a good place to start. If taking on a whole package seems like a bit much, check out our “Issues” section here to find specific issues you could help tackle in a package.\nFor the big picture, watch the video of Noam Ross’s useR! 2020 keynote, “Peer-Reviewing R Code: Where We’ve Been and Where We’re Going at rOpenSci”\nRead how our Dev Guide has been used in the wild in a manuscript review: When Standards Go Wild - Software Review for a Manuscript, and in the core curriculum of a Master of Data Science program: Using rOpenSci Software Peer Review Guidelines for Teaching.\n\n3.11.1 How to contribute\n\n\nLearn about reviewer guidelines. Read the Guide for Reviewers\n\n\nVolunteer to review a package. Fill out this form to get started. You’ll be contacted by an editor when a submitted package fits your profile. First-time reviewers are paired with more experienced reviewers and can request guidance from an editor.\n\nSubmit your package for peer review. Read the Guide for Authors and then submit a pre-submission inquiry to the GitHub repository where reviews take place to see if your package is in scope for rOpenSci.\n\nPublish a paper about your package. See above for our collaborations with the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and Methods in Ecology and Evolution.\n\nAcknowledge your reviewers in your package DESCRIPTION (with their consent). Read about this in Thanking Your Reviewers: Gratitude through Semantic Metadata.\nAdd a CITATION file to ensure your package is easily citable\n\n\nRequest a co-maintainer for your package. Post a request in the #package-maintenance Slack channel.\n\nVolunteer to maintain a package. Check out the rOpenSci Newsletter, the last section is a “Call For Maintainers” and consists of a list of packages specifically looking for maintainers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-Universe logo grey background with white text ‘rOpenSci R-universe’.

We welcome contributions to the project either by filing suggestions as issues in the book’s GitHub repository, or by submitting a pull request.\n\nContact us directly (via Slack or our contact form) to inquire about submitting a statistical software package for pre-review."
