## Blog {#blog}

The rOpenSci blog contains both long form [blog posts](https://ropensci.org/blog/) and shorter [tech notes](https://ropensci.org/technotes). 
It’s a large, rich resource for learning about the R packages developed by staff and by community members and how people use them, 
the people and processes involved in our open software peer review system, and the value people get from being part of our community. 
We’ve published more than 500 posts since 2012 with more than half written by community members. 
The long form blog posts are for a broad readership, 
and the shorter tech notes include information on a software release with major new features, 
breaking changes, or significant new documentation for example. 

This list gives you a taste of some themes.

```{r posts, results="asis", message = FALSE}
make_category <- function(category, posts) {
    post_list <- paste0("<ul>",
        glue::glue_collapse(
          glue::glue_data(
              posts[posts$category == category,], 
              "<li> [{title}]({url}) {description}</li>",
              .na = ""
              ),
          sep = "\n"
    ),
    "</ul>")
    
   glue::glue("<li><details closed>\n<summary> <span title='Click to Expand'> {category} </span> </summary>\n{post_list}\n</details></li>")
}
posts <- readr::read_csv2("blog_themes/blog_themes.csv")
cat(paste0(
    "<ul>",
    glue::glue_collapse(
    purrr::map_chr(unique(posts$category), make_category, posts = posts),
    sep = "\n"),
    "</ul>"
    ))
```
