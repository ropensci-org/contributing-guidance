# Master Actions List

### A note about links

Within a Resource section, links to THAT resource, actually link externally to the resource  \  
i.e. in the blog resource section, links to the blog link to [https://ropensci.org/blog](https://ropensci.org/blog)

Links to a Resource in a DIFFERENT section link to that section  \
i.e. in the blog resource section, links to the blog guide link to #blogguide

### A note about text

Text in the **MAIN bullet** is the “common” action text, and ALSO the text to be inserted into Motivations Chapter. 

Text in **SUB bullets** is either for Resources Chapter (noted Chp 3) with additional details that may differ depending on the section but which are easier to keep consistent if we have it here (e.g., for the “Write a blog post” text which occurs in three different sections), OR it shows slightly different variations on the action depending on the specific "I want to.."
