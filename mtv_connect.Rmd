## Connect {#connect}

An implicit value in participating in rOpenSci is the connections people make with other scientists, R users, developers, or research software engineers who want to do their research in a more open and reproducible fashion. The rOpenSci community is a welcoming place to connect with like-minded people who share interests and values and a motivation to develop the related skills, techniques, and practices.
