rOpenSci's [R-universe](https://ropensci.org/r-universe/) is a new platform which launched in 2021 with the aim of improving publication and discovery of R research software.

The R-universe provides three main services.

1. **Serving packages**
  - Anyone can set up a personal R-universe which can build and serve any package hosted on a public git server.
  - Pre-building packages simplifies installation of non-CRAN packages
  - Articles are also rendered, providing a method for hosting non-software packages, such as research articles bundled as an R package.

2. **Monitoring software health and activity**
  - While still in early development, the goal is to have a system for monitoring software metrics to assess the role and impact of different software
  
3. **Discovery and recommendation**
  - The R-universe [front-end dashboard](https://r-universe.dev) cross-links Universes, Maintainers, Articles and different software packages in an effort to increase visibility and help users find new R packages
  - One goal is to be able to offer recommendations to users
