## Help {#help}

One major motivation for contributing to rOpenSci is people’s desire to 
“give back” in appreciation of good software, good infrastructure, 
and a good community in which folks share their gratitude often and openly. 
The ways you can help are limitless. We encourage people to support others by 
sharing their experience or expertise. 
Don’t underestimate the value of sharing your first-time experience doing a thing; 
that is an immense help to others who don’t yet recognize the value of their own contributions.
